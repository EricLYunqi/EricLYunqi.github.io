# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi! I am Yunqi Li, a CS PhD student in my rookie season at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), where I am fortunate to work with Prof. Yongjoo Park. Before that, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/)
  and spent a semester on exchange at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).


  My research interests lie in multi-modal data management from a systems perspective. Before starting my PhD, I worked with Prof. Dong Deng on data integration, and with Prof. Xiaofang Zhou and Prof. Kai Huang on graph queries. Later, I interned at the [OceanBase Lab, Ant Group](https://en.oceanbase.com/), focusing on transaction processing in distributed databases.
