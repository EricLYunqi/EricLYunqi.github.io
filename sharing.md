I was born and grew up in [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an), a historic city who has served as capital for ancient China 13 times, then I moved to [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) for undergrad study at 18. Also, I once lived in [Amherst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst,_Massachusetts), [Huddersfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield) and [Waterloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Ontario) for a while.
